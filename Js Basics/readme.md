• Differentiate between Statically typed and Dynamically typed programming languages and give examples of languages that fall under each category
 - dynamically-typed languages perform type checking at runtime, while statically typed languages perform type checking at compile time.  This means that scripts written in dynamically-typed languages (like Groovy) can compile even if they contain errors that will prevent the script from running properly (if at all). If a script written in a statically-typed language (such as Java) contains errors, it will fail to compile until the errors have been fixed.
 - Second, statically-typed languages require you to declare the data types of your variables before you use them, while dynamically-typed languages do not. 

 - Examples of dynamically-typed languages are Perl, Ruby, Python, PHP, JavaScript.
 - Examples of statically-typed languages are Java, C, C++, C#

• Differentiate between the JavaScript data types ‘null’ and ‘undefined
 - undefined is a type, whereas null an object
 - null is an assigned value. It means nothing, whereas undefined means a variable has been declared but not defined yet.
